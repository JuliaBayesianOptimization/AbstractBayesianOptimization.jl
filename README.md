## About

This package formulates a prototypical Bayesian optimization algorithm using abstract building blocks. Currently it supports gradient free optimization only.

It comes with a basic `OptimizationHelper` that provides utilities for unconstrained problem definition and logging.

The purpose of this little framework is to reuse code and to expose Bayesian optimization algorithms via a unified interface.
