# AbstractBayesianOptimization

*This repo contains experimental code at the moment.*

## About

This package implements a prototypical Bayesian optimization algorithm using abstract building blocks. It also provides basic utilities for problem definition and logging.

The purpose of this little framework is to reuse code when implementing a new Bayesian optimization algorithm in Julia and to expose it via a unified interface.
